# Stock_Price_Prediction

I implemented this project based on the ideas presented in this paper: [Stock Price Prediction Using Hidden Markov Models](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~bdhingra/papers/stock_hmm.pdf)


**Methodology**
1. Preprocessing the dataset.
2. Feature engineering.
3. Experimenting with HMMGMM model and fine-tuning the hyperparameters.
4. Experimenting with an LSTM model and fine-tuning the hyperparameters.

**Results**

Model  |     MSE loss                  
------ | ----------------
HMMGMM |    239.2     
LSTM   |    273.70
